# Get Started

API
The subscription form uses a specific API key. For a tutorial to connect your form to Google Sheets, visit https://medium.com/@dmccoy/how-to-submit-an-html-form-to-google-sheets-without-google-forms-b833952cc175. You will need to read through the comments for a complete description of setting up the API as Google's Developer Console has changed since the original publication of the blog post.

Libraries
This website uses both the minified versions of Bootstrap 3.3.7 for responsiveness and jQuery 3.3.1. Using Bootstrap 4 may affect the site.
